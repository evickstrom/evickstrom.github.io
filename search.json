We hypothesize that irregular legal status results both in direct territorial confinement--inability to visit the homeland--in indirect caging of remitting, an important non-mobile transnational activity. This caging is hypothesized to result from an attenuation of social ties associated with reduced physical co-presence with kin and other important individuals in the homeland. Using longitudinal data on Senegalese migrants in France, Italy, and Spain from the MAFE Project, we find that Senegalese migrants who lack of secure legal status are effectively confined to the destination territory, preventing them from making short visits to the homeland. The direct and indirect relationships between irregular status and remittances, though, vary by destination country: the hypothesized relationships are not evident for migrants in Spain, indicating the role played by other facets of the context of reception, such as policy tolerance and the characteristics of the co-ethnic community.","tags":[],"title":"Irregular Status, Territorial Confinement, and Blocked Transnationalism: Legal Constraints on Circulation and Remittances of Senegalese Migrants in France, Italy, and Spain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erik R.

This article draws on retrospective data from the MAFE-Senegal (Migration between Africa and Europe) survey to show that the effect of legal status on Senegalese migrants' labor market participation in France, Italy, and Spain differs for men and women because of gendered immigration policies. We find that there is little association between Senegalese men's legal status and their labor force participation. For Senegalese women, however, those who legally migrate to these countries for family reunification are more likely to be economically inactive upon arrival than women with other legal statuses. Family reunification does not preclude labor market participation entirely, however, as some of these women eventually transition into economic activity.","tags":[],"title":"Legal Status, Gender, and Labor Market Participation of Senegalese Migrants in France, Italy, and Spain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erik R.

This study is a first step in attempting to assess the continued validity of the English-ability item using data from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL). We first attempt to assess the empirical comparability of the NAAL and the 2003 American Community Survey (ACS) by comparing the two surveys' distributions of some key demographic variables. We then analyze NAAL prose literacy scores and find that the self-reported English ability of NAAL speakers of languages other than English (LOTE) differentiates identifiable levels of literacy, and that among groups of NAAL LOTE speakers, those who report speaking English 'very well' have the literacy profiles that come closest to those of English-only speakers. This study thus provides evidence supporting the use of the English-ability item as a valid measure of English literacy. In addition, these results may provide some guidance regarding the average literacy levels associated with different responses to the ACS English-ability question.","tags":[],"title":"How Well--Still Good?

Drawing on literature on the sociolegal production of migrant irregularity, this study hypothesizes that variation in contexts of reception and migrants' access to forms of capital and institutional connections will produce different pathways. Retrospective MAFE-Senegal data provide legal status histories. Results show pathways that occur early in a migrant's trip-no-visa entry and overstaying-are more sensitive to both contextual variables and access to forms of capital. In contrast, befallen irregularity is less related to contextual variation.","tags":[],"title":"Pathways into Irregular Status Among Senegalese Migrants in Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alejandro Portes","Erik Vickstrom"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1412035200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1412035200,"objectID":"d4cc94916ec8afdce1be8b1711551aeb","permalink":"https://evickstrom.github.io/publication/2014-01-01_portesdiversitysocialcapital2014/","publishdate":"2014-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-01-01_portesdiversitysocialcapital2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Processes of social change brought about by international migration usually entail multiple kinds of diversification affecting ethnicities and identities, languages, gender balances, social statuses, skills and more.

Independently collected data for both generations allow us to establish effects of parental characteristics on children's orientations without the confounding potential inherent in children's reports about parents. We analyse first determinants of parental ambition and, through a series of stepwise regressions, the effects of these goals and other parental and family characteristics on children's aspirations and expectations. A structural equations model synthesizes the results of the analysis. The model confirms predictions from the research literature, especially those based on the Wisconsin status attainment model, but rejects others, including the predicted significance of private versus public school attendance. Parental ambition, knowledge of Spanish by parents and children, gender and children's age are major determinants of youths' educational and occupational goals. These results have direct implications for policy; these are discussed in the conclusion.
