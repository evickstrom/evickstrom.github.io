  abstract = {We examine determinants of educational and occupational aspirations
and expectations among children of immigrants in Spain on the basis of a
unique data set that includes statistically representative data for foreignorigin
secondary students in Madrid and Barcelona plus a sample of onefourth
of their parents. Independently collected data for both generations
allow us to establish effects of parental characteristics on children's
orientations without the confounding potential inherent in children's
reports about parents. We analyse first determinants of parental ambition
and, through a series of stepwise regressions, the effects of these goals and
other parental and family characteristics on children's aspirations and
expectations. A structural equations model synthesizes the results of the
analysis. The model confirms predictions from the research literature,
especially those based on the Wisconsin status attainment model, but
rejects others, including the predicted significance of private versus public
school attendance. Parental ambition, knowledge of Spanish by parents
and children, gender and children's age are major determinants of youths'
educational and occupational goals. These results have direct implications
for policy; these are discussed in the conclusion.
