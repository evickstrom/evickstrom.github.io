  abstract = {We review the bourgeoning literature on ethno-racial diversity and its
alleged effects on public trust and cohesion in the context of the evolution
of the concept of social capital and earlier claims about itsmanifold
positive effects. We present evidence that questions such claims and
points to the roots of civicness and trust in deep historical processes
associated with race and immigration.We examine the claims that immigration
reduces social cohesion by drawing on the sociological classics
to show the forms of cohesion that actually keep modern societies together.
This leads to a typology that shows ``communitarianism'' to be
just one such form and one not required, and not necessarily ideal, for
the smooth operation of complex organizations and institutions. Implications
of our conclusions for future research and immigration policy
are discussed.},
