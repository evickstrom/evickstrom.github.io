  abstract = {Processes of social change brought about by international migration usually entail multiple kinds of diversification affecting ethnicities and identities, languages, gender balances, social statuses, skills and more. Compiled and introduced by a leading figure in the field, Migration and Diversity draws together key social scientific studies addressing varieties of migration-driven diversification. Contributions also examine state responses to, and the wider effects of, the new social, economic and political configurations that arise from migration. Combining empirical and theoretical works, this volume will be useful for undergraduate and graduate students through to professional scholars engaging in some of the most topical issues of today.},
